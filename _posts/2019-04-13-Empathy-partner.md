When I cam to Hack Reactor, I started with the desire to be more technically proficient. In that regard, I'm ecstatic about the rate of progress.

Something I didn't anticipate though, was being so inspired by real life demonstrations of focused empathetic communication.

As a paired partner, I've come to realize the importance of establishing a safe space to express ideas, not just for my partner, but for myself as well. I've learned there are times when two individuals have separate ideas, and the best one is not either of them, but rather the convergence of the two. Finding that convergence is not about selling either side on who's right.

More on this later.
