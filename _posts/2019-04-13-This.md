No matter what Marcus says, THIS is hard as hell to understand.

Let's try to figure it out.

## Method is called by owning object

In a function or method, 'this' refers to the object the method or function belongs to *at time of execution*. So if we have an object eric, which has a method move(), it'd look like this:

```
var person = {
  position: 0,
  move: function() {
    this.position++;
  }
};

person.move(); // position === 1
```

Move() is called by 'person', and inside the move function, *this* references the 'person' object. This is obvious enough just by looking to the left of the dot:
```
person.move();
```

**BUT**, there are twists. 

## Method is called by global object

*This* belongs to *the object that executes the function call*. 

Why is this confusing? Because sometimes a function isn't immediately executed. Instead it's passed to another function (e.g. setTimeout()) to be executed at a later time. At the time the function setTimeout() is executed, *this* is a reference to the object that executed setTimeout().

Let's look:
```
var person = {
  name: 'eric',
  sayHi: function() {
    console.log('Hi, my name is ' + this.name);
  }
};

setTimeout(person.sayHi, 1000);
```

Let's be clear. The person object is *not* the object that executed sayHi. 

**setTimeout** has the **function definition** as a parameter, and executes it at a *later* time. Why is the function definition important? Because all setTimeout has is

```
function() {
    console.log('Hi, my name is ' + this.name);
  }
```

In fact, it has no idea who 'person' is, or that 'person' owns the function object. It simply has the function definition to execute at a later time.

Therefore, the object that *this* references isn't 'person'. *This* references the object it's called by. 

Since setTimeout executes sayHi, and setTimeout is called by the global object, which is **window**, the window object is what *this* references. 

When we call

```
setTimeout(person.sayHi, 1000);
```

We get the output
```
Hi, my name is window
```

## bind()

When we encounter situations where it's possible to lose a *this* binding, it's possible to permanently bind this using bind(). 

bind() is a method of all function objects, and receives a *this* reference as a parameter to bind the function to.

In the previous example, *this* referenced the window object.

```
setTimeout(person.sayHi, 1000);
```

If we want to keep reference to the person object, we can change the call to:

```
setTimeout(person.sayHi.bind(person), 1000);
```

Note, bind is similar to apply() and call() in that it forces a *this* reference, but unlike apply() and call(), it does *not* immediately execute the function.

If we execute the line above, we'll get the desired output:

```
Hi, my name is eric
```

## apply() and call()

Along with bind(), every function object has an apply() method and a call() method. Similar to bind(), they force a *this* reference.

The difference it apply() and call() will execute the function immediately.

apply() and call() function essentially the same, except if called on a function with parameters, apply() accepts an array of parameters and call() accepts N parameters.

```
person.listAppendages.apply(person, ['arms', 'legs']);
person.listAppendages.call(person, 'arms', 'legs');

```

**Important:** we should *not* use apply() nor call() in the setTimeout function in the previous example. Recall that apply() and call() will execute a function immediately. So if used in the context of setTimeout, they would cause the function to execute regardless of wait time.
