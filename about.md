I'm a software engineer with a lof of passions trying to be great at sometimes too many things. You can always find me doing one of the following:
- Training Brazilian Jiu Jitsu
- Practicing Yoga
- Riding my bicycle in the California hills and backroads
- Feverishly coding whatever project I'm currently on
